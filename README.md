# distributed key generation

## **WIP**

This is a fork of [dfinity/dkg](https://github.com/dfinity/dkg) which uses [herumi/bls-wasm](https://github.com/herumi/bls-wasm) instead of [dfinity/js-bls-lib](https://github.com/dfinity/js-bls-lib)

The API is almost the same, except some methods no longer require passing in an instance of the bls library,
